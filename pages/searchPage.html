                    <h1>Jordan Gana</h1>
                    <h4>Okay so I've figured out how to use SASS to make custom style sheets and change the variables like the color themes and such.
                        I'm confused about how I'm supposed to use that to set page styles though.
                        Lets say I want every card to have certain attributes for the text of its card-body, card-title and card-footer classes... how do I modify those?
                        Am I really supposed to go to each card and do
                        Or is there someway I can achieve this with custom scss with just using the properties of card-footer and <p> tags instead of changing every one?
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        Edit: Also is there a way to set a maximum amount a column will resize down to before it stacks instead? I'm trying to use 4 cards but if they resize too small the title lines wrap and then suddenly the alignment of the titles and pictures in the cards is different in each card and it looks awful.
